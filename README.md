A program to predict the number of deaths from the number of new coronavirus infections in Japan in 2020

It is a simple one, and the accuracy is poor because the test data is insufficient and the error is 59 people. However, since the model of the explanation and the objective variable itself has an accuracy of 90% or more, and the regression data are correlated, this time it is a single regression of only the number of infected people, but probably work, diet, family composition etc. are added. It will be a reference when you make multiple regressions in the event.

In the future, we plan to analyze by improving the prediction accuracy or performing multiple regression.
